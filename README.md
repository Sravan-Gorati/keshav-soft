# Task 1 Report: Keshav soft

## 1. Project Development Process

I initiated the project by setting up a basic folder structure consisting of three pages:

* **index.html** (Home)
* **about.html** (About)
* **contact.html** (Contact)

To simplify the setup, I integrated **Bootstrap 5 via CDN**, which eliminated the need for any local installation.

After reviewing the official **Bootstrap documentation and examples**, I selected key components such as **navbars, hero sections, cards, and forms** to serve as the foundation of the website.

* On the **Home page**, I designed a responsive navbar, a welcoming hero banner, a features section built with cards, and a footer.
* On the **About page**, I presented the mission and vision using Bootstrap’s card layout.
* On the **Contact page**, I implemented a form with fields for name, email, and message, styled using Bootstrap form controls.

The project primarily relied on **Bootstrap’s utility classes** for spacing, colors, and responsiveness, which minimized the requirement for custom CSS. Once the design was consistent across pages, I deployed the site using **GitHub Pages** and also experimented with **Netlify** for hosting.

## 2. Resources Utilized

* Guidance and starter code support from *ChatGPT*.
* *Official Bootstrap documentation* for understanding the grid system, components, and utility classes.
* Code snippets from *Bootstrap examples* (e.g., navbar and form), which were customized to meet project requirements.

## 3. Challenges Encountered

One of the main challenges was understanding the **grid system** and how layouts adapt across different screen sizes. I addressed this by experimenting with breakpoints in the browser’s developer tools until the responsiveness was satisfactory.

Another difficulty was ensuring that **navbar links** functioned correctly across all pages. Initially, some links failed due to incorrect relative paths, which I resolved by carefully checking and updating the file structure.

Deployment also posed a challenge since I was new to **GitHub Pages**. After some trial and error, I successfully configured the repository by enabling the main branch as the source, which allowed me to generate a live deployment link.

## 4. Key Learnings

This project served as a strong **practical introduction to Bootstrap 5**. I gained hands-on experience in building a **responsive multi-page website** with minimal custom CSS and became familiar with Bootstrap’s **grid system, utilities, and pre-built components**.

In addition, I practiced **version control using Git and GitHub** and learned to host websites on both **GitHub Pages and Netlify**. Completing this project gave me greater confidence in my ability to plan, develop, and deploy small-scale web applications independently.
